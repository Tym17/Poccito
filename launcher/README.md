# Launcher
Don't forget to `yarn install` if you don't have the node modules already.

Launch the window using `yarn start`.

## Configuration
```json
{
    "debugmode": false,
    "msredis": "./install/vcredist_x86.exe",
    "game": "./bin/PoccitoClient.exe"
}
```
Debugmode makes the window resizable and allow the dev tools to be oppened. The 2 other values are the position of each executable once the game is packed up.
